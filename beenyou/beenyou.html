		<p id="para1">Feelin' the remnants, gone in an instance<br>Blink of an eye, no goodbye<br>I had a notion, deep as the ocean<br>Blue like the sky, oh my</p>
		<p>Like a permanent stain<br>Wishin' I could just wash away<br>Away<br>And our love was in vain<br>Who was to blame for all the pain? For all the pain?</p>
		<p>If I would've known, if I would've known<br>If I would have known it could have been you<br>If I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new<br>I never wanted to be, wanted to be your remnant<br>Oh, no, but if I, if I would've known<br>If I would have known it could have been you<br>Been you</p>
		<p>There are percussions, I'm missing your loving<br>Must be the night, the ghost of a life<br>All of the memories<br>A serenity dwindling my mind<br>All the time</p>
		<p>Like a permanent stain<br>Wishin' I could just wash away<br>Away<br>Hate or love was insane<br>Who was to blame for all the pain? For all the pain?</p>
		<p>If I would've known, if I would've known<br>If I would have known it could have been you<br>If I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new<br>I never wanted to be, wanted to be your remnant<br>Oh, no, but if I, if I would've known<br>If I would have known it could have been you<br>Been you</p>
