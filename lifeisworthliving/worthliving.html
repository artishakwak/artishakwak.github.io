		<p id="para1">Ended up on a crossroad<br>Try to figure out which way to go<br>It's like you're stuck on a treadmill<br>Running in the same place<br>You got your hazard lights on now<br>Hoping that somebody would slow down<br>Praying for a miracle<br>Who'll show you grace?<br>Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas<br>With a long journey ahead<br>Seen a truck pull over<br>God sent an angel to help you out<br>He gave you direction<br>Showed you how to read a map<br>With a long journey ahead<br>Said it ain't over<br>Oh, even in the midst of doubt</p>
    <p>Life is worth living<br>Life is worth living, so live another day<br>The meaning of forgiveness<br>People make mistakes doesn't mean you have to give in<br>Life is worth living again</p>
    <p id="para2">Relationship on a ski slope<br>Avalanche comin' down slow<br>Do we have enough time to salvage this love?<br>Feels like a blizzard in April<br>'Cause my heart is just that cold<br>Skating on thin ice<br>But it's strong enough to hold us up<br>Seem her scream and holler<br>Put us both on blast<br>Tearing each other down<br>When I thought it was over<br>God sent us an angel to help us out<br>He gave us diretion, showed us how to make it last<br>For that long journey ahead<br>Said it ain't ever over<br>Oh, even in the midst of doubt</p>
    <p>Life is worth living<br>Life is worth living, so live another day<br>The meaning of forgiveness<br>People make mistakes doesn't mean you have to give in<br>Life is worth living again<br>Life is worth living again</p>
    <p id="para3">What I'd give for my affection<br>Is a different perception<br>From what the world may see<br>They try to crucify me<br>I ain't perfect, won't deny<br>My reputation's on the line<br>So I'm working on a better me</p>
    <p>Life is worth living<br>Life is worth living, so live another day<br>The meaning of forgiveness<br>People make mistakes<br>Only God can judge me<br>Life is worth living again<br>Another day<br>Life is worth living again</p>
