    	<h1>Love Yourself</h1>
		<p id="para1">For all the times that you rain on my parade<br>And all the clubs you get in using my name<br>You think you broke my heart, oh, girl for goodness' sake<br>You think I'm crying on my own. Well, I ain't</p>
        <p>And I didn't wanna write a song<br>'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care. I don't,<br>But you still hit my phone up<br>And, baby, I be movin' on<br>And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back,<br>Maybe you should know that</p>
        <p id="para2">My mama don't like you and she likes everyone<br>And I never like to admit that I was wrong<br>And I've been so caught up in my job,<br>Didn't see what's going on<br>But now I know,<br>I'm better sleeping on my own</p>
        <p>'Cause if you like the way you look that much<br>Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself<br>And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'<br>You should go and love yourself</p>
        <p id="para3">And when you told me that you hated my friends<br>The only problem was with you and not them<br>And every time you told me my opinion was wrong<br>And tried to make me forget where I came from</p>
        <p>And I didn't wanna write a song<br>'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care. I don't,<br>But you still hit my phone up<br>And, baby, I be movin' on<br>And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back,<br>Maybe you should know that</p>
        <p>My mama don't like you and she likes everyone<br>And I never like to admit that I was wrong<br>And I've been so caught up in my job,<br>Didn't see what's going on<br>But now I know,<br>I'm better sleeping on my own</p>
        <p>'Cause if you like the way you look that much<br>Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself<br>And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'<br>You should go and love yourself</p>
        <p>For all the times that you made me feel small<br>I fell in love. Now I feel nothin' at all<br>And never felt so low when I was vulnerable<br>Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?</p>
        <p>'Cause if you like the way you look that much<br>Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself<br>And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'<br>You should go and love yourself</p>
        <p>'Cause if you like the way you look that much<br>Oh, baby, you should go and love yourself<br>And if you think (you think) that I'm<br>(that I'm) still holdin' on (holdin' on) to somethin'<br>You should go and love yourself</p>
