	<h2>Additive</h2>
	<p>Additive color is color created by mixing a number of different light colors with red, green, and blue being the primary colors normally used in the additive color system.</p>
	<h2>Subtractive</h2>
	<p>A subtractive color model explains the mixing of a limited set of dyes, inks, paint pigments or natural colorants to create a wider range of colors, each the result of partially or completely subtracting (that is, absorbing) some wavelengths of light and not others.</p>

<section id="theory">
	<h2>Theory of Color</h2>
	<p>Color theory encompasses a multitude of definitions, concepts and design applications - enough to fill several encyclopedias. However, there are three basic categories of color theory that are logical and useful : The color wheel, color harmony, and the context of how colors are used.</p>
	<h3>Primary</h3>
    <p>Any of a group of colors from which all other colors can be obtained by mixing.</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Red</li>
        <li>Yellow</li>
        <li>Blue</li>
    </ul>
	<h3>Secondary</h3>
    <p>The secondary colors are cyan (a mixture of blue and green), magenta (a mixture of blue and red), and yellow (a mixture of green and red). Each secondary color is also the complementary color (or complement) of the primary color whose wavelength it does not contain.</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Purple</li>
        <li>Orange</li>
        <li>Green</li>
    </ul>
	<h3>Tertiary</h3>
    <p>Tertiary colors are the resulting color formed when an equal amount of a primary and a secondary color are mixed. The primary and secondary color must be beside each other on the color wheel. For example, a mixture of 50-percent red and 50-percent magenta would result in the tertiary color of orange.</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Red-Purple</li>
        <li>Red-Orange</li>
        <li>Yellow-Orange</li>
        <li>Yellow-Green</li>
        <li>Blue-Purple</li>
        <li>Blue-Green</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="models">
	<h2>Color Models</h2>
	<p>Unlike RGB, which is an additive color model, CMYK is a subtractive color model. Typically used in printing, CMYK assumes that the background is white, and thus subtracts the assumed brightness of the white background from four colors: cyan, magenta, yellow, and black (called “key”).</p>
	<h3>Analogous</h3>
	<p>Analogous colors are groups of three colors that are next to each other on the color wheel, with one being the dominant color, which tends to be a primary or secondary color, and a tertiary. Red, orange, and red-violet are examples.</p>
	<h3>Monochromatic</h3>
	<p>Monochromatic colors are all the colors (tints, tones, and shades) of a single hue. Monochromatic color schemes are derived from a single base hue and extended using its shades, tones and tints. Tints are achieved by adding white and shades and tones are achieved by adding a darker color, gray or black.</p>
	<h3>Triadic</h3>
	<p>A triadic color scheme uses colors that are evenly spaced around the color wheel. Triadic color harmonies tend to be quite vibrant, even if you use pale or unsaturated versions of your hues.</p>
	<h3>Complementary</h3>
	<p>Colors directly opposite each other in the color spectrum, such as red and green or blue and orange, that when combined in the right proportions, produce white light.</p>
